Reflection

When I started working on the codes, I followed my design plan which helped me not get too lost when actually writing the code. But, honestly, the hardest part of this assignment was getting the JUnit tests working smoothly. Writing the tests wasn’t the issue cuz most of them are similar. But at first, I kept running into problems cuz the expected output didn’t match what `selectWinner()` was returning, and I wasn’t sure if the problem was with my tests or with my code. Debugging it took way longer than I expected. I had to go back and see how votes were being assigned. And another thing that was kinda frustrating was setting up Git and making sure everything was pushed correctly. There were a few times where I thought I committed my changes, but nothing was updating on GitHub, and I had to go back and redo it. Also, VS Code kept auto-formatting my code in weird ways, and I had to go and fix random syntax things that it added. If I had chance to do it again, I will probably write the JUnit tests earlier instead of waiting until I had most of the program done, since it would’ve helped catch issues sooner.
